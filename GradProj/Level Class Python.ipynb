    "In object orients programming langauges, like Java and Python, classes allows us to define our own types. Once we have defined those types we in fact made a blueprint of what this class can do. Once we have out blueprint, we can then create objects of that class or type. An object is an instance of a class, think of it as you were building a house. TO build a house, you need a blueprint, that blueprint was the entire design of what the house will look like, once you ahve tat blueprint, you can then make as many houses as you want this that design.\n",
